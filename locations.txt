LOCATION 1
False
You are in an empty study room. The only exit is North to the library.
This study room is completely empty. And by empty, we mean, absolutely empty. All the tables and chairs have been taken out,
the whiteboards taken off the wall, not even the carpeting is left. Are they planning to do something else with this space?
END

LOCATION 2
False
You are on the main floor of the UTM library. There is an empty study room to the South, an exit from the library to the North.
This is the main floor of the UTM library. It's usually crowded at this time of the day, but today it's eerily quiet.
Only a few students are studying inside one of the study rooms. You better not disturb them. A librarian stands near the
service desk, looking bored and sleepy.
END

LOCATION 3
False
You are outside of the library. There is a Starbucks to the North, and the hallway to CCT to the West.
This is the hallway outside the main doors of the library. There are small tables and chairs scattered about the outside of Starbucks.
A banner stands by the front doors advertising a past event. There is a smell of coffee in the air.
END

LOCATION 4
False
You are standing in Starbucks. The only exit is in the South to the outside of the library.
Ah, the smell of overpriced caffeinated drinks welcomes you to Starbucks.
You could go for a little bit of jolt in your system after studying all night, but you've got more important matters on hand.
END

LOCATION 5
False
You are standing in the hallway that links the library in the East to the CCT atrium in the West.
The hall spans a long distance, making the commute frustrating on school days.
Windows allow the sunlight to fill the corridor.
END

LOCATION 6
False
You are in the CCT atrium. Circuit Break Cafe is in the South, the junction is in the West, and the hallway is East.
It's quite spacious and open here with the high ceilings and large windows,
and it would be almost peaceful if not for the ENORMOUS crowd of people waiting around Circuit Break Cafe nearby.
They are here waiting for the Math Proofs exam which you are definitely NOT ready for.
END

LOCATION 7
False
You are in the junction of paths outside CCT. You can go North to the Student Centre or East to the CCT atrium.
The sun is shining down on the junction, but you don't feel particularly sunny right now.
You can see your breath in the air and a few students hustling to their destinations.
END

LOCATION 8
False
You are inside the Student Centre. The only exit is back South to the junction.
Despite the line for the printers being too long whenever you're in a rush to print something off for class, they are empty today.
There is a girl behind the desk talking to her friends WAY too loudly, and you wish you could be enjoying yourself as much she is.
END

LOCATION 9
False
You are standing in Circuit Break Cafe. The CCT atrium is to the North and your exam room is in the South.
The students crowd into this section of CCT, many burrowing their noses in math notes in last-minute cramming.
You would be doing the same but you've got an even worse crisis on hand.
That is: if you don't get yourself in there with that tcard, pen, and cheat sheet in time YOU ARE SCREWED.
END

LOCATION 10
False
You are in the theatre where your exam is held. The only exit is North to Circuit Break Cafe.
Professors and TAs stand like sentinels among the rows of tables.
You are definitely not ready for this.
